# Principles

The future will bring us hundreds of language models and dozens of providers for each. 
*How will you choose the best?*

## Prioritize price or performance

Targon scouts for the lowest prices and best latencies/throughputs across dozens of providers, 
and lets you choose how to prioritize them.

## Standardized API

No need to change your code when switching between models or providers. You can even let users 
choose and pay for their own.

## The best models will be used the most

Evals are flawed. Instead, compare models by how often they're used for different purposes. 
Chat with multiple at once in the Chatroom.
