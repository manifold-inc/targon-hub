# Limits

## Rate Limits and Credits Remaining

To check the rate limit or credits left on an API key, make a GET request to `https://targon.sybil.com/api/v1/auth/key`.

```javascript
fetch('https://targon.sybil.com/api/v1/auth/key', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer $TARGON_API_KEY',
  },
});
```

If you submit a valid API key, you should get a response of the form:

```typescript
type Key = {
  data: {
    label: string;
    usage: number; // Number of credits used
    limit: number | null; // Credit limit for the key, or null if unlimited
    is_free_tier: boolean; // Whether the user has paid for credits before
    rate_limit: {
      requests: number; // Number of requests allowed...
      interval: string; // in this interval, e.g. "10s"
    };
  };
};
```

There are a few rate limits that apply to certain types of requests, regardless of account status:

- **Free limit**: If you are using a free model variant (with an ID ending in `:free`), then you will be limited to 20 requests per minute and 200 requests per day.
- **DDoS protection**: Cloudflare's DDoS protection will block requests that dramatically exceed reasonable usage.

For all other requests, rate limits are a function of the number of credits remaining on the key or account. For the credits available on your API key, you can make **1 request per credit per second** up to the surge limit.

For example:

- 0 credits → 1 req/s (minimum)
- 5 credits → 5 req/s
- 10 credits → 10 req/s
- 1000 credits → 200 req/s

If your account has a negative credit balance, you may see `402` errors, including for free models. Adding credits to put your balance above zero allows you to use those models again.

## Token Limits

Some users may have too few credits on their account to make expensive requests. Targon provides a way to know that before making a request to any model.

To get the maximum tokens that a user can generate and the maximum tokens allowed in their prompt, add authentication headers in your request to `https://targon.sybil.com/api/v1/models`:

```javascript
fetch('https://targon.sybil.com/api/v1/models', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    Authorization: 'Bearer $TARGON_API_KEY',
  },
});
```

Each model will include a `per_request_limits` property:

```typescript
type Model = {
  id: string;
  pricing: {
    prompt: number;
    completion: number;
  };
  context_length: number;
  per_request_limits: {
    prompt_tokens: number;
    completion_tokens: number;
  };
};
```
