# API Keys

Users or developers can cover model costs with normal API keys. This allows you to use `curl` or the OpenAI SDK directly with Targon. Just create an API key, set the `api_base`, and optionally set a referrer header to make your app discoverable to others on Targon.

> **Note:** API keys on Targon are more powerful than keys used directly for model APIs. They allow users to set credit limits for apps, and they can be used in OAuth flows.

## Example code
```
import openai
openai.api_base = "https://targon.sybil.com/api/v1"
openai.api_key = $TARGON_API_KEY
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
model="openai/gpt-3.5-turbo",
messages=[...],
headers={
"HTTP-Referer": $YOUR_SITE_URL, # Optional, for including your app on targon.sybil.com rankings.
"X-Title": $YOUR_APP_NAME, # Optional. Shows in rankings on targon.sybil.com.
},
)
reply = response.choices[0].message
```

To stream with Python, see this example from OpenAI.
