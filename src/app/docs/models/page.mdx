# Models

Model usage can be paid by users, developers, or both, and may shift in availability. 
You can also fetch models, prices, and limits via API.

## Text models

| Model Name & ID | Prompt cost ($ per 1M tokens) | Completion cost ($ per 1M tokens) | Context (tokens) | Moderation |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Example Model   | $X.XX                         | $X.XX                             | XXXX              | Yes/No     |

## Media models

**Note:** Different models tokenize text in different ways. Some models break up text into 
chunks of multiple characters (GPT, Claude, Llama, etc) while others tokenize by character (PaLM). 
This means that the number of tokens may vary depending on the model.
